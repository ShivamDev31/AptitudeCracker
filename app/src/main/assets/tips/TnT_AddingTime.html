<p><h1><b><i> Adding Time</i></b></h1></p>
<p>Here is a nice simple way to add hours and minutes together: </p>
<p>Let's add 1 hr and 35 minutes and 3 hr 55 minutes together.</p>
<p>What you do is this:</p>
<p>Make the 1 hr 35 minutes into one number, which will give us 135 and do the same for the other number, 3 hours 55 minutes, giving us 355.</p>
<p>Now you want to add these two numbers together: </p>
<p>135<br />
355<br />____ <br />
490</p>
<p>So we now have a sub total of 490. What you need to do to this and all sub totals is amd add the time constant of 40.</p>
<p>No matter what the hours and minutes are, just add the 40 time constant to the sub total.</p>
<p>490 + 40 = 530</p>
<p>So we can now see our answer is 5 hrs and 30 minutes!</p>
