		<u>Step1</u>: Ask for the Date. Ex: 23<sup>rd</sup> June 1986<br>
		<u>Step2</u>: Number of the month on the list, June is 4.<br>
		<u>Step3</u>: Take the date of the month, that is 23<br>
		<u>Step4</u>: Take the last 2 digits of the year, that is 86.<br>
		<u>Step5</u>: Find out the number of leap years. Divide the last 2 digits of the year by 4, 86 divide by 4 is 21.<br>
		<u>Step6</u>: Now add all the 4 numbers: 4 + 23 + 86 + 21 = 134.<br>
