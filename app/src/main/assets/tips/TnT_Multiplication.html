<p><h1><b><i>Multiplication Tricks</i></b></h1></p>

<p><h2><b>--Trick One--</b></h2></p>
<p> <b>Multiplication</b> </p>
<p> <b>Example : 43 x 78</b> </p>
<p><b> Step 1 : Finding the Units digit</b></p>
<p> The first objective would be to get the units digit.</p>
<p>In order to do this we just need to multiply the units digit of both the numbers. thus, 3 x 8 would give us 24. </p>
<p>Hence, we would write 4 in the units digit of the answer and carry over the digit 2 to the tens place as follows </p>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp  43<br />x  78<br />______<br />&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   4 <br/> 2 carry over to the tens place.</p>  
<p>   At this point we know that the units digit is 4 and also that there is a carry over of 2 to the 
tens place of the answer.</p>
<p><b> Step 2 : Finding the tens place digit</b></p>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp  43<br />x  78<br />______<br />&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 5 4 <br/>5 carry over to hundereds place.<br /></p>
<p><b> Thought process :</b></p>
<p> 4 x 8 + 3 x 7 = 32 + 21 = 53<br /> 53 + 2 ( from carry over ) = 55<br /> Thus we write 5 in the tens place and carry over 5 to hundereds place</p>
<p> In the above case, we have multiplied the units digit of the second number with the tens digit of the first number and added the multiplication of the units digit of the first number with the tens digit of the second number.
<p> Thus we would get : 8 ( units of digit of the second number ) x 4 ( tens digit of the first number ) + 7
( tens digit of the second number ) x 3 ( Units digit of the first number ) + 2 ( caryy over over from the units digit calculation ).<br />
    = 32 + 21 + 2 = 55.</p>
<p> We write down 5 in the tens digit of th answer and carry over 5 to the hundereds digit of the answer.</p>
<p><b> Step 3 : Finding hundereds place digit</b></p>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp  43<br />x  78<br />______<br />3 3 5 4 </p>
<p><b> Thought Process :</b><br /><br />            4 x 7 = 28<br />            28 + 5 = 33</p>
<p> Since, 4 & 7 are the last digits on the left in both the numbers this is the last calculation in this problem and hence we can write 33 for the remaining 2 digits in the answer.</p>
<p>Thus, the answer to the question is 3 3 5 4.</p><br /> <br />

<p><h2><b>--Trick Two--</b></h2></p>

<p><b>Multiply two digit numbers</p></b>
<p>Lets take an example : 96*96</p>
<p>Take hundred as the reference.then think what should be subtracted from 96 to make it hundred (-4).</p>
<p>Then write like this</p>
<p>96 96</p>
<p>-4 -4</p>
<p>Add diagonally 96-4=92</p>
<p>Multiply -4*-4=16</p>
<p>The product of 96*96 will be 9216</p><br /><br />

<p><h2><b>--Trick Three--</b></h2></p>

<p><b>Multiply 2 digits number ending with 5 with itself</p></b>

<p>Take a number ending with 5 and then multiply it by itself</p>
<p>Lets take an example : 35*35</p>
<p>Multiply the first digit ie 3 with the (digit+1)=4</p>
<p>3*4=12</p>
<p>These r the first two nos of ans. The last two nos will always be 25</p>

<p>So the ans is 1225</p>


<p><h2><b>--Trick Four--</b></h2></p>

<p><b>Multiply Up to 20X20 In Your Head</p></b>

<p<In just FIVE minutes you should learn to quickly multiply up to 20x20 in your head.  With this trick, you will be able to multiply any two numbers from 11 to 19 in your head quickly, without the use of a calculator.</p>
<p>I will assume that you know your multiplication table reasonably well up to 10x10.</p>

<p>Try this:</p>
<p>Take 15 x 13 for an example.</p>
<p>Always place the larger number of the two on top in your mind.</p>
<p>Then draw the shape of Africa mentally so it covers the 15 and the 3 from the 13 below. Those covered numbers are all you need.</p>
<p>First add 15 + 3 = 18</p>
<p>Add a zero behind it (multiply by 10) to get 180.</p>
<p>Multiply the covered lower 3 x the single digit above it the "5" (3x5= 15)</p>
<p>Add 180 + 15 = 195.</p><br /><br />


<p><h2><b>--Trick Five--</b></h2></p>

<p><b>Multiply any 2 digit no by 11</b></p>

<p>Lets say you want to multiply 52*11.This can be calculated in less than 1 second but if you want to do it traditionally,it will take you around 5-6 seconds.Isn't it?</p>
<p>So let see how using a simple mental maths trick,this calculation can be done in a matter of seconds...</p>
<p>To multiply 52 and 11,imagine there is a space between 52.</p>
<p>52*11= 5_2 (Put an imaginary space in between).</p>
<p>Now,what to do with that space?.</p>
<p>Just add 5 and 2 and put the result in the imaginary space.</p>
<p>So, 52 * 11 =572 (which is your answer).</p>

<p>Lets try some more examples:</p>


<p>1) 35 * 11 = 3 (3+5) 5 = 385</p>

<p>2) 81 * 11 = 8 (8+1) 1 = 891</p>

<p>3) 72 * 11 = 7 (7+2) 2 = 792 etc..</p><br /><br />

<p><h2><b>--Trick Six--</b></h2></p>

<p><b>Multiplying by 12 - shortcut</p></b>
<p><b>So how does the 12's shortcut work?</p></b>
<p>Let's take a look at : 12 X 7</>
<p>The first thing is to always multiply the 1 of the twelve by the number we are multiplying by, in this case 7.</p>
<p>So 1 X 7 = 7.</p>
<p>Multiply this 7 by 10 giving 70. (Why? We are working with BASES here.</p>
<p>Bases are the fundamentals to easy calculations for all multiplication tables.</p>
<p>Now multiply the 7 by the 2 of twelve giving 14. Add this to 70 giving 84.</p>
<p>Therefore 7 X 12 = 84</p>
<p>Let's try another : 17 X 12</p>
<p>Remember, multiply the 17 by the 1 in 12 and multiply by 10(Just add a zero to the end)</p>
<p>1 X 17 = 17, multiplied by 10 giving 170.</p>
<p>Multiply 17 by 2 giving 34.</p>
<p>Add 34 to 170 giving 204.</p>
<p>So 17 X 12 = 204</p>
<p>Lets go one more : 24 X 12</p>
<p>Multiply 24 X 1 = 24. Multiply by 10 giving 240.</p>
<p>Multiply 24 by 2 = 48. Add to 240 giving us 288.</p>
<p>24 X 12 = 288 </p><br /><br />

<p><h2><b>--Trick Eight--</b></h2></p>

<p><b>Multiply by 5</p></b>

<p><b>Step 1: </b>Take any number, then divide it by 2</p>
<p><b>Step 2: </b>If the result is whole, add a 0 at the end.</p>
<p><b>Step 3: </b>If it is not, ignore the remainder and add a 5 at the end. </p>
<p><b>Step 4: </b>2682 x 5 = (2682 / 2) & 5 or 0</p>
<p><b>Step 5: </b>2682 / 2 = 1341 (whole number so add 0)</p>
<p><b>Step 6: </b>Ans:13410</p>
<p><b>Step 7: </b>Letâ€™s try another:5887 x 5,2943.5 (fractional numbers (ignore remainder, add 5)</p>
<p><b>Answer : </b>29435</p><br /><br />


<p><h2><b>--Trick Nine--</b></h2></p>

<p><b>Tough Multiplication</p></b>

<p><b>Step 1: </b>If you have a large number to multiply and one of the numbers is even, you can easily subdivide to get to the answer</p>
<p><b>Step 2: </b>Ex:32 x 125, is the same as: 16 x 250 is the same as: 8 x 500 is the same as: 4 x 1000 = 4,000</p>
