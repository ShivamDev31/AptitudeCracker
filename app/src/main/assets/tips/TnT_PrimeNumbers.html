<p><h1><b><i>Prime Number Tricks</i></b></h1></p>

<p><b><h2>--Properties of Prime Numbers--</h2></b></p>
<p>1. The lowest prime number is 2.</p>
<p>2. 2 is also the only even prime number.</p>
<p>3. The lowest odd prime number is 3.</p>
<p>4. The remainder when a prime number p > 5 is divided by 6 is 1 or 5.
 However if a number on being divided by 6 gives a remainder of 1 or 5 the number need not to be prime.</p>
<p>5. The remainder of the division of the square of a prime number p > 5 is divided by 24 is 1.</p>
<p>6. For prime numbers p > 3, p<sup>2</sup> - 1 is divisible by 24.</p>
<p>7. Prime numbers between 1 to 100 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.</p>
<p>8. Prime numbers between 100 to 200 are 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199.</p>
<p>9. If a and b are any 2 odd primes then a<sup>2</sup> - b<sup>2</sup> is composite. Also, a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> is composite.</p>
<p>10. The remainder of the division of a square of a prime number p > 5 is divided by 12 is 1.</p>

<p><b><h2>--To check a whether a number is prime or not--</h2></b></p>

<p>To check whether number n is prime, adopt the following process.</p>
<p>a. Take the square root of the number.</p>
<p>b. Round the square root to the immediately lower integer. Call this number z.</p>
<p>e.g If you have to check 181, its square root will be 13.-.</p>
<p>Hence, the value of z, in this case will be 13.</p>
<p>c. Check for divisibility of the number n by all prime number below z. If there is no prime number below the value of z which divides n, then the number n will be prime.</p>
<p>To illustrate:</p>
<p>The value of &#8730 239 lines between 15 to 16. Hence, take the value of z as 15.</p>
<p>Prime numbers less than 16 are 2, 5, 7, 11 and 13, 239 is not divisible by any of these. Hence you can conclude that that 239 is a prime number.</p>


<p><b><h2>--Checking whether a number is prime ( for numbers below 49 )--</h2></b></p>
<p> The only number you would need to check for divisibility with is the number 3. Thus, 47 is prime because it is not divisible by 3.<p/>

<p><b><h2>--Checking whether a number is prime ( for numbers above 49 below 121 )--</h2></b></p>
<p>Naturally you would need to check this with 3 and 7. But if you remember that 77, 91 and 119 are not prime, you would be able to spot the prime numbers below 121 by just checking for divisibility with the number 3.</p>
<p>e.g 61, is prime because it is not divisible by 3 and it is neither 91 nor 119.</p>

<p><b><h2>--Checking whether a number is prime ( for numbers above 121 below 169 )--</h2></b></p>
<p>Naturally you would need to check this with 3, 7 and 11. But if you remember that 133, 143 and 161 are not prime, you would be able to spot the prime numbers between 129 to 169 by just checking the divisibility with number 3.</p>
<p>e.g 149, is prime because it is not divisible by 3 and it is neither 133, 143 nor 161.</p>
