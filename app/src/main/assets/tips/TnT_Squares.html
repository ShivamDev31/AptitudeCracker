<p><h1><b><i>Square Tricks</i></b></h1></p>

<p><h2><b>--Properties of Squares--</b></h2></p>
<p>1. When a perfect square is written as a product of its prime factors, each prime factor will appear an even number of times.</p>
<p>2. The difference between the squares of 2 consecutive natural numbers is always equal to the sum of the natural numbers. Thus, 41<sup>2</sup> - 40<sup>2</sup> = (40 + 41) = 81. this property is very useful when used in opposite direction.
 --- i.e. Given that the difference between the squares of 2 consecutive integers is 81, you should immediately realise that the numbers should be 40 and 41.</p>
<p>3. The square of a number ending in 1, 5 or 6 also ends in 1, 5 or 6 respectively.</p>
<p>4. The square of any number ending in 5: The last 2 digits will always be 25. The digits before that in the answer will be got by multiplying the digits leading up to the digit 5 in the number in the number by 1 more than itself.</p>
<p>5. The value of a perfect square has to end in 1, 4, 5, 6, 9 or even number of zeros. In other words a perfect square cannot end in 2, 3, 7 or 8 or an odd number of zeros.</p>
<p>6. If the units digit of the square of a number is 1, then the number should end in 1 or 9.</p>
<p>7. If the units digit of the square is 4, then the units digit of the number is 2 or 8.</p>
<p>8. If the units digit of the square is 9, then the units digit of the number is 3 or 7.</p>
<p>9. If the units digit of the square is 6, then the units digit of the number is 4 or 6.</p>
<p>10. The sum of the squares of the first 'n' natural numbers is given by : [(n) (n + 1) (2n + 1)] / 6.</p>
<p>11. The square of a number is always non-negative.</p>

<p><h2><b>--Squares for numbers from 31 to 50--</b></h2></p>
<p>Such numbers can be treated in the form (50 - x) and the above process modified to the values of squares from 31 to 50. Again to explain we will use an example. Suppose you have to find the square of 41.</p>
<p><b>Step 1 : </b> Look at 41 as (50 - 9).</p><p> Again similar to what we did above, realise that the answer has 2 parts -- The first 2 and last 2 digits.</p>
<p><b>Step 2 : </b> The last 2 digits are got by the last 2 digits in the value of (-9)<sup>2</sup> = 81. Hence, 81 will represent last 2 digits of 41<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p><b>Step 3 : </b> The first 2 digits are derived by 25 - 9 = 16 (where 25 is a standard number to be used in all cases and -9 comes from fact that (50 -9) = 41).</p>
<p>Hence, the answer is 1681.</p>


<p><h2><b>--Squares for numbers from 51 to 80--</b></h2></p>
<p><b>Note : </b> This method depends on your memory of first 30 numbers.</p>
<p>Such numbers can be treated in the form (x + 50) and the above process modified to the values of squares from 51 to 80. Again to explain we will use an example. Suppose you have to find the square of 76.</p>
<p><b>Step 1 : </b> Look at 76 as (50 + 26).</p><p> Again similar to what we did above, realise that the answer has 2 parts -- The first 2 and last 2 digits.</p>
<p><b>Step 2 : </b> 26<sup>2</sup> is 676. Hence, The last 2 digits of the answer will be 76 and we will carry over 6.</p>
<p><b>Step 3 : </b> The first 2 digits of the answer will be 25 + 26 + 6 = 57.</p>
<p>Hence, the answer is 5776.</p>


<p><b>Find square of a number between 50 and 60</p></b>
<p>Lets explain by examples :</p>
<p>56^2=3136</p>
<p>57^2=3249</p>
<p>58^2=3364</p>
<p>There is a 2 steps trick to get the answer</p>
<p><b>Step 1 :</b> Add the digit at the units place to 25 and write the sum.</p>
<p><b>Step 2 :</b> Then calculate the square of units place digit and write it.</p>
<p>Lets elaborate the example of 56^2</p>
<p>We have 25+6=31.<br />And square of 6 is 36.<br />Hence the result is 3136</p>

<p><h2><b>--Squares for numbers from 81 to 100--</b></h2></p>

<p><p>Suppose you have to find the value of 82<sup>2</sup>. The following process will give you the answer.</p>
<p><b>Step 1 : </b> Look at 82 as (100 - 18).</p><p> The answer will have 4 digits whose values will be got by focussing on getting the value of the last 2 digits and that of the first 2 digits.</p>
<p><b>Step 2 : </b> The value last 2 digits will be equal to the last 2 digits of (-18)<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p> Since, (-18)<sup>2</sup> = 324, the last 2 digits of 82<sup>2</sup> will be 24. The '3' in the hundereds place of (-18)<sup>2</sup> will be carried over to the other part of the answer. </p>
<p><b>Step 3 : </b> The first 2 digits of the answer will be 25 + 26 + 6 = 57.</p>
<p>Hence, the answer is 5776.</p>


<p><h2><b>--Trick Six--</b></h2></p>
<p><b>Simple math tips and tricks helps in squaring a digit.</p></b>
<p>Use the below formula to find out the shortcut of square 'n' numeral.</p> 
<p>
a<sup>2</sup> = [((a+b)<sup>2</sup> + (a-b)<sup>2</sup>) / 2] - b<sup>2</sup><br /><br />
<b>Step 1: </b>Let us consider any two digits for e.g. 6 and 2.<br />
<b>Step 2: </b>Now begin the calculation. In the formula, assign six in the place of 'a' and mention two in the place of 'b'.<br />
<b>Step 3: </b> 6<sup>2</sup> = [((6+2)<sup>2</sup> + (6-2)<sup>2</sup>) / 2] - 2<sup>2</sup>   <br />
<b>Step 4: </b>Add the values in first box and then find square root for the obtained value. For e.g. 6 + 2 = 8. Now square the 8 i.e. 8 x 8 
gives 64.<br />
<b>Step 5: </b>Then subtract the values in second box and find the square root for the obtained value. For e.g. 6 - 2 = 4 and square the 4 that is, 4 x 4 gives 16.<br />
<b>Step 6: </b>Now find the square root of two that is, 2 x 2 = 4.<br />
<b>Step 7: </b>Write as like 6<sup>2</sup> = (64 + 16 ) / 2 - 4<br />
<b>Step 8: </b>Add the values that is, 64 and 16, then divide it by two.<br /> For e.g. 64 + 16 = 80 / 2 => 40. <br />
<b>Step 9: </b>Subtract forty with four. 40 - 4 = 36.<br />
<b>Step 10: </b>Therefore, 6<sup>2</sup> = 36. </p> <br /><br />

<p><b>Quick Square Trick</p></b>
	
<p><b>Step 1: </b>If you need to square a 2 digit number ending in 5, you can do so very easily with this trick. </p>
<p><b>Step 2: </b>Mulitply the first digit by itself + 1, and put 25 on the end. </p>
<p><b>Step 3: </b>That is all!</p>
